# üöÄ usb_autorun_network_drive

**usb_autorun_network_drive** is a utility designed to automate the process of establishing a VPN connection upon inserting a USB drive into a Windows system. By leveraging the `autorun.inf` feature, this tool initiates a VPN connection seamlessly, enhancing user convenience and ensuring secure network access.

## üìÇ Repository Contents

- `autorun.inf`: Configuration file that triggers the automatic execution of the VPN connection script when the USB drive is inserted.
- `AutoVPN.bat`: Batch script responsible for initiating the VPN connection.
- `AutoVPN.exe`: Executable version of the `AutoVPN.bat` script for environments where batch scripts are restricted.
- `vpn.ico`: Custom icon associated with the autorun action for visual identification.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

- **Operating System**: Windows XP or later.
- **VPN Client**: Ensure that the target system has the necessary VPN client installed and configured.
- **USB Drive**: A USB flash drive with sufficient storage to hold the required files.

## üîß Setup Instructions

1. **Prepare the USB Drive**:
   - Format the USB drive to a compatible file system (e.g., FAT32 or NTFS).
   - Assign a unique volume label to the USB drive for easy identification.

2. **Copy Files to the USB Drive**:
   - Place the `autorun.inf`, `AutoVPN.bat`, `AutoVPN.exe`, and `vpn.ico` files in the root directory of the USB drive.

3. **Modify VPN Connection Details**:
   - Edit the `AutoVPN.bat` script to include the correct VPN connection name, username, and password. Ensure that these credentials are securely stored and handled.

4. **Enable Autorun on the Target System**:
   - Verify that the Windows system has the autorun feature enabled. Note that some systems may have autorun disabled due to security policies.

## üöÄ Usage

- **Connecting to the VPN**:
  - Insert the configured USB drive into the Windows system.
  - If autorun is enabled, the system will prompt you with the autorun options. Select the option to run the VPN connection script.
  - The script will execute, establishing the VPN connection automatically.

- **Disconnecting from the VPN**:
  - Manually disconnect the VPN connection through the VPN client interface or use a corresponding script if available.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Considerations

- **Autorun Security Risks**:
  - Be aware that enabling autorun can pose security risks, as it may allow malicious software to execute automatically. Ensure that the USB drive comes from a trusted source.

- **Credential Management**:
  - Store VPN credentials securely. Avoid hardcoding sensitive information in scripts. Consider using encrypted storage or prompting for credentials at runtime.
